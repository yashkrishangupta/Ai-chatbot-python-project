## Chatbot Capabilities

The AI Assistant can respond to a wide range of topics and queries, including:

- Greetings and farewells
- Questions about itself and its features
- Responding to user emotions (happiness, sadness)
- Jokes and humor
- Interesting facts
- Questions about AI and technology
- Philosophical inquiries
- Music, movies, and books
- And much more!

When no rule-based pattern matches, Gemini AI takes over to provide smart and contextual responses.

## Customization

You can expand the chatbotâ€™s rule-based knowledge by editing the `self.patterns` list in `chatbot.py`:

```python
self.patterns = [
    (r'\b(your pattern regex)\b', [
        "Response option 1",
        "Response option 2",
        "Response option 3"
    ]),
    # ...
]
```
